NAME
     dotfiles - macOS development environment setup automation

SYNOPSIS
     make [target]

DESCRIPTION
     The dotfiles repository provides automated setup for a complete macOS
     development environment using Makefile-based configuration management.

     All configuration files are copied (not symlinked) to their target
     locations, removing repository dependencies after installation.
