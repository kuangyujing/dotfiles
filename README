DOTFILES(1)                    User Commands                    DOTFILES(1)

NAME
     dotfiles - macOS development environment setup automation

SYNOPSIS
     make [target]

DESCRIPTION
     The dotfiles repository provides automated setup for a complete macOS
     development environment using Makefile-based configuration management.

     All configuration files are copied (not symlinked) to their target
     locations, removing repository dependencies after installation.

TARGETS
     help
             Display available targets and their descriptions (default).

     setup
             Basic environment setup including:
             - Homebrew installation
             - 23 development packages (bash, git, go, node@22, CLI utilities)
             - Homebrew Bash as default shell
             - Bash configuration (bashrc -> ~/.profile)
             - Font installation to ~/Library/Fonts
             - Vim configuration and plugins via vim-plug
             - Git configuration

     setup-apps
             Install macOS applications and configure system settings:
             - iTerm2, Alt-Tab, Displaperture, LinearMouse, Stats
             - Visual Studio Code
             - LinearMouse configuration
             - Global key repeat enabled for all applications

     setup-extra
             Install additional development tools:
             - Development CLI tools (kubectl, kubecolor, awscli, azure-cli, docker)
             - Additional development CLI tools (lazygit, lazydocker)
             - Development desktop applications (Docker Desktop, GitHub Desktop)

     setup-all
             Complete environment setup (setup + setup-extra + setup-apps):
             - All components from 'setup' target
             - All components from 'setup-extra' target
             - All components from 'setup-apps' target

     uninstall
             Remove all configurations and restore system defaults:
             - Remove configuration files
             - Delete Vim configuration and plugins
             - Remove installed fonts
             - Uninstall all Homebrew packages
             - Restore default shell to /bin/bash
             - Remove Homebrew Bash from /etc/shells

PACKAGE MANAGEMENT
     The brewfiles/ directory contains host-specific subdirectories for daily
     backups of installed packages. Each host has its own Brewfile maintained
     separately from the Makefile automation:

         brewfiles/[hostname]/Brewfile

     These Brewfiles serve as backup references and are not used by the
     automated Makefile setup process.

     To create a Brewfile backup for the current host:

         make backup-brewfile

     This command automatically detects the hostname and creates a backup of
     all currently installed Homebrew packages (excluding VS Code extensions).

     _configure-git          Copy git configuration to ~/.gitconfig
     _configure-system       Configure global system settings (key repeat)

         make setup

EXAMPLES
     Basic environment setup:
         make setup

     Install additional development tools:
         make setup-extra

     Install only macOS applications:
         make setup-apps
